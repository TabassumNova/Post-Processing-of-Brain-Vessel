# Post-Processing of Cerebrovascular Models after DTF-skeletonization
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the most popular imaging modality for detecting strokes that can produce highly resolved images. But sometimes it is difficult to locate the exact location of a stroke because of the surrounding vessels and bones. A graph of the complete vessel tree can give the physicians an overview of the patientâ€™s vessel structure. In this project, I have analyzed the geometrical and structural shapes of skeletonized graph images of brain vessels and proposed solutions to reconstruct them according to the actual structure of the vessel tree.
